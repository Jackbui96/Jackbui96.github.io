### Introduction
My name is Nguyen Bui, and Iâ€™m a recent software engineering graduate from San Jose State University. I am currently working as a software engineering intern at OmniPreSense. At the moment, I am most comfortable in developing Android apps. With that said, I am open to learning new technologies as I am not afraid to try out new things. Down below is a description of what projects I am working on right now.

### Current Projects

#### [Speed Reporting Radar Gun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.omnipresense.radarApp&hl=en_US){:target="_blank"}

This is an Android app that turns your device into a radar gun. What you need to do is connect your device to any OPS board using the OTG cable.

Here is a list of features developed by me:
 - Display the object speed in real-time.
 - Capture photos when the object tripped over the speed limit.
 - Overlay photos with information such as date/time, the object's speed, lat/lng, address.

Worth mentioning app performances:
 - Gives users a smooth experience by utilizing asynchronous threading.
 - Able to get the user's location by utilizing Google Maps API.
 - The camera feature is created as a service. Therefore, it can capture photos while the app is running in the background.
 - The app is able to minimize itself. This will let the user know where to point their device while the app is in the background.
